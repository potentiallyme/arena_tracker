# ARENA TRACKER  
Very primitive way to store who you've completed in arena  
A one-file vanilla python3 script with a small GUI to add and update a list of champs you've gotten 1st place with in arena in League of Legends  
(For those arena hunters trying to complete every champ)  
  
To note:  
`<Enter>` to submit  
`<Escape>` to exit  
Modify the path to the `.txt` file (and its name) in the .py file at the top of the file (line 5)  
I hardcoded the tk grid because a loop just made it annoying and i wanted to keep this a quick, single day endeavour  
So if you wanna change the colors, good luck (luckily there are just 3 colors, black, white, #424242 (a nice grey))    
I spent more time learning tk and struggling because I have no IDE (coded no Notepad lol) thank writing the program so it's probably error-prone?  
  
That's pretty much it, thanks
